# Titanic Survival Prediction using TensorFlow

## Overview:

- This project aims to predict the likelihood of a passenger surviving the Titanic shipwreck
- Preprocessing techniques to deal with both categorical and numerical data types
- Model is trained on features such as age, sex, passenger class, etc using a Linear Classifier provided by TensorFlow
- Performance is evaluated using the testing data, and the accuracy metric is printed as an outcome

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Number of siblings and spouses aboard  
- Number of parents and children aboard  
- Passenger class  
- Deck  
- Embarkation town   
- Alone status   
- The label for prediction is whether the passenger survived or not
- The dataset is split into training (train.csv) and testing (eval.csv) data

## Installation: 

1. Clone the repo:
```
https://github.com/williamlin6803/Survival.git
```
2. Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies
3. Execute the Python script: python titanic_survival_prediction.py

## Results:

- The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set (replace X with the actual result)

## Future Plans:

- Implement more sophisticated models like Random Forests or Neural Networks for better accuracy
